a. The List of the Features Implemented:
- Social Media: Facebook - User can log in with Facebook accounts. By selecting the button "Log in with Facebook", it will immediately send user to Facebook log in page. We are still working to connect that with the menu screen.
- Creating a New User: User can create an account with email and password, and when they click "Sign up" button, the data will store to web service, and the menu screen appears. Use web services to store data of user, so they can use the account, they suddenly create to access the app to the main menu screen.
- Calculating The Score, Live with appearing as Toast to tell you what your currently score and live
- The timer starts counting down since the user begin the app with all the category. When time is up, the user will ask to go "Result" screen to see the score. 
- Sharing score, the user might share their score to friend by logging in Facebook, or can play again, or log out the game, or view the top of the score they have played that by select "Leaderboard" at the "Result" screen.
- The category retrieves data from the web service but it needs to access to the internet.

- Main Menu - Choose category and instruction are done and working perfectly.
- Multiple-Choice Question - The multiple-choice question and the counting score up, and live down are successfully working, for those two category Algebra and Calculus. We use graphic image to make the choosing game in Geometry category.
- Interactive Math - For this use case, we have made a fun game it is called â€œAllAboutMath" in the category. The user has to sum/subtract/multiple/device quickly in mind to get the answer as the app is given for.
